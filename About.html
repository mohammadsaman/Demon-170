        <h2>1,025Hp</h2> 
    <p>Make no mistake. The limited-production 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT® Demon 170, featuring the first-ever 1,000-plus-horsepower production HEMI® engine, is absolutely here to kick ass and cross names off the competitor lane list. The seventh and final Last Call Special Edition is already banned in its stock form by the NHRA thanks to dominating the quarter-mile with a certified 8.91-seconds ET at 151.17 mph.

    With only a red key in hand, horsepower levels are determined by the percentage of ethanol fuel detected. A recalibrated powertrain control module optimizes fueling and spark timing for both premium and high-ethanol-blended fuel to unlock the full horsepower potential.
    
    What does it take to achieve a 40% boost increase1, go 0-60 mph in 1.66 seconds and generate the highest g-force acceleration of any production car2 at 2.004 Gs? Next-level engineering, a hell of a lot of determination, testing and passion to deliver the craziest performance numbers ever for the Brotherhood of Muscle. </p>  
    <p>Production is limited to 3,300 at most based on production capacity, with 300 destined for Canada. Ordering opens Monday, March 27 at a U.S. MSRP3 of $96,666 and Canadian MSRP3.1 of $134,785. With options to choose from including 14 exterior colors, 2 Satin Black paint options, 4 interiors and optional carbon fiber wheels, there's guaranteed to be a configuration that fuels your fire.
